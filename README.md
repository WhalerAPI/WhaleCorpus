# 🐋 WhaleLogic Knowledge Base

**A doctoral-level knowledge base and research environment for software engineering, AI, and business growth.**

This repository is designed to serve as a **living textbook + research archive + business strategy guide**, powered by modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The goal:  
- Educate to the **doctoral level** in **Software Engineering, Cloud Computing, Distributed Systems, and Artificial Intelligence**.  
- Provide **industry-ready software knowledge** in Go, Rust, Python, and modern systems design.  
- Capture **business strategy, small business growth, and entrepreneurship practices**.  
- Act as a **self-hosted mentor/PhD advisor in a box** — a system you can query and expand over time.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Build a **structured knowledge base** that spans from CS foundations to cutting-edge AI.  
2. Ingest research papers, notes, and experiments into a **vector database** for semantic search.  
3. Develop a **RAG agent** capable of:  
   - Answering doctoral-level software and AI questions.  
   - Guiding a self-study curriculum.  
   - Advising on technical + business growth strategies.  
4. Integrate with **real-world projects**: APIs, cloud services, RAG pipelines, SaaS.

## 🏗 Roadmap

**Phase 1:**  
- Build foundational notes in Markdown.  
- Collect research papers (PDFs, Markdown summaries).  
- Organize business + strategy guides.  

**Phase 2:**  
- Ingest into **Weaviate/Qdrant** vector database.  
- Develop a Go/Python ingestion pipeline.  

**Phase 3:**  
- Build a **RAG agent** using LangChainGo / LangChain Python + OpenAI.  
- Enable **semantic search + structured queries**.  

**Phase 4:**  
- Add **curriculum guidance** → agent suggests study paths.  
- Expand to **mentor mode** → critiques writing, research, and code.

## 🚀 Vision

This project isn’t just a repo. It’s a **doctoral self-education platform** and a **business incubator knowledge engine**.  

By combining **deep CS theory**, **practical engineering**, **AI research**, and **entrepreneurial strategy**, this knowledge base aims to:  

- Serve as the backbone for building **production-grade systems**.  
- Provide the knowledge to scale from **individual projects → SaaS products → companies**.  
- Create a **personal AI mentor** to push research and business development forward.
